You have access to a large collection of documents \\nfrom AWS documentation, particularly SageMaker and have to answer in details and explain clearly.\\n <|eot_id|>\\n<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|> \\nPlease answer my question only based on provided context.\\n\\n\\n-----------\\nThis is the context:\\nKmsKey The AWS Key Management Service key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt captured data at rest using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Required: No Type: String Maximum: 2048 Pattern: .* Update requires: No interruption\\n\\nKmsKeyId The AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. The KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats: + Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab + Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab + Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias + Alias name ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's account. For more information, see KMS-Managed Encryption Keys in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that you specify in your CreateModel request. For more information, see Using Key Policies in AWS KMS in the * AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. Required: No Type: String Maximum: 2048 Pattern: .* Update requires*: Replacement\\n\\nThe status field provides more information using the following fields: + Additional: Additional information about the status of the hosting deployment. This field is optional and only gets populated in case of error. + Creation Time: When the endpoint was created in SageMaker. + Endpoint ARN: The SageMaker endpoint ARN. + Endpoint Config Name: The SageMaker name of the endpoint configuration. + Endpoint Name: The SageMaker name of the endpoint. + Endpoint Status: The status of the endpoint. + Endpoint URL: The HTTPS URL that can be used to access the endpoint. For more information, see Deploy a Model on SageMaker Hosting Services. + FailureReason: If a create, update, or delete command fails, the cause is shown here. + Last Check Time: The last time the operator checked the status of the endpoint. + Last Modified Time: The last time the endpoint was modified. + Model Names: A key-value pair of HostingDeployment model names to SageMaker model names.\\n\\nInvoking the Endpoint\\n\\nOnce the endpoint status is InService, you can invoke the endpoint in two ways: using the AWS CLI, which does authentication and URL request signing, or using an HTTP client like cURL.
