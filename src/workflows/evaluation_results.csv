0,What is SageMaker?,"['Working with Amazon SageMaker\n\nAmazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models. See the following resources for complete code examples with instructions.\n\nLink to Github\n\nLink to AWS Code Sample Catalog', ""Train and Evaluate AWS DeepRacer Models Using SageMaker Notebooks\n\nThe AWS DeepRacer console provides you with an integrated experience to train and evaluate your AWS DeepRacer models. It's integrated because AWS DeepRacer uses SageMaker and AWS RoboMaker behind the scenes. The integration includes detailed reinforcement learning tasks and makes training more readily accessible to beginners.\n\nIf you're an experienced user of SageMaker or if you're determined to learn how to use SageMaker and AWS RoboMaker to train and evaluate your AWS DeepRacer models, then you can manually create an SageMaker notebook. You can then clone a reinforcement learning sample notebook instance and use it as a template to perform the predefined tasks that train and evaluate an AWS DeepRacer model.\n\nAfter the training, you can copy the trained model artifacts to your AWS DeepRacer vehicle for test runs in a physical environment.\n\nThe tutorial presents step-by-step instructions to walk you through these tasks.\n\nTopics + Create an SageMaker Notebook + Initialize the SageMaker Notebook Instance + Set Up the Training Environment + Train Your AWS DeepRacer Model\n\nCreate an SageMaker Notebook\n\nTo train an AWS DeepRacer model directly on SageMaker, follow the steps below and create an SageMaker notebook instance.\n\nTo create an SageMaker notebook instance to train and evaluate your AWS DeepRacer models"", 'Sell Amazon SageMaker Algorithms and Model Packages\n\nSelling Amazon SageMaker algorithms and model packages is a three-step process:\n\nDevelop your algorithm or model, and package it in a Docker container.

There are three steps to preparing your product:\n\nPackaging your code into images – To prepare a model package or algorithm product, you must create the Docker container images for your product.\n\nUploading your images – After packaging your code in container images and testing them locally, upload the images and scan them for known vulnerabilities. Fix any vulnerabilities before continuing.\n\nCreating your Amazon SageMaker resource – After your images are scanned successfully, they can be used to create a model package or algorithm resource in SageMaker.']","Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service provided by AWS that enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models.
