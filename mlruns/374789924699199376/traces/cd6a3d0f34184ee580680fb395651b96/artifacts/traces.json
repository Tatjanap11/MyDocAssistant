The KmsKeyId can be any of the following formats: + Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab + Key ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab + Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias + Alias name ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias If you don't provide a KMS key ID, Amazon SageMaker uses the default KMS key for Amazon S3 for your role's account. For more information, see KMS-Managed Encryption Keys in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide. The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that you specify in your CreateModel request. For more information, see Using Key Policies in AWS KMS in the * AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
