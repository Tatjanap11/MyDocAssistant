1. Go to the Amazon SageMaker console.
2. Navigate to the Endpoints section.
3. Select the endpoint you want to check.
4. Click on the endpoint name to view its details.
5. Scroll down to the ""Encryption"" section.
6. Look for the ""KmsKeyId"" field. If it is present and has a value, it indicates that the endpoint is KMS encrypted.

Alternatively, you can also check the endpoint configuration using the AWS CLI or SDKs. You can use the `describe-endpoint` command to get the endpoint configuration, and then check the `KmsKeyId` field in the response.

For example, using the AWS CLI:
```bash
aws sagemaker describe-endpoint --endpoint-name <endpoint-name>
```
In the response, look for the `KmsKeyId` field. If it is present and has a value, it indicates that the endpoint is KMS encrypted.

You can also check the endpoint configuration using the AWS SDKs. For example, in Python:
```python
import boto3

sagemaker = boto3.client('sagemaker')

response = sagemaker.describe_endpoint(EndpointName='<endpoint-name>')

if 'KmsKeyId' in response and response['KmsKeyId']:
    print(""The endpoint is KMS encrypted"")
else:
    print(""The endpoint is not KMS encrypted"")
```
Note that if the `KmsKeyId` field is not present or has a value of `null`, it indicates that the endpoint is not KMS encrypted.",0.23076923076923078,0.9402054041025534,0.8055555555287036
