An execution role is an IAM role that grants the service permission to access your AWS resources. An execution role consists of permissions and trust policy. The trust policy specifies which principals have the permission to assume the role.\n\nUse the following procedure to create an execution role with the IAM managed policy, AmazonSageMakerGeospatialFullAccess, attached. If your use case requires more granular permissions, use other sections of this guide to create an execution role that meets your business needs.\n\nEvery organization has its own set of standards and practices that provide security and governance for its AWS environment. SageMaker provides a set of first-party templates for organizations that want to quickly get started with ML workflows and CI/CD. The templates include projects that use AWS-native services for CI/CD, such as AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeCommit. The templates also offer the option to create projects that use third-party tools, such as Jenkins and GitHub. For a list of the project templates that SageMaker provides, see Use SageMaker-Provided Project Templates.\n\nYou pass the role (iam:PassRole) when making these API calls: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_geospatial_StartEarthObservationJob.html, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_geospatial_StartVectorEnrichmentJob.html, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_geospatial_ExportEarthObservationJob.html, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_geospatial_ExportVectorEnrichmentJob.html.\n\nYou attach the following trust policy to the IAM role, which grants SageMaker principal permissions to assume the role, and is the same for all of the execution roles:\n\n{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"Service\": [ \"sagemaker-geospatial.amazonaws.com\" ] }, \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\" } ] }\n\nThe permissions that you need to grant to the role may vary depending on the API that you call. The following sections explain these permissions.\n\nImportant The IAM managed policy, AmazonSageMakerGeospatialFullAccess, used in the following procedure only grants the execution role permission to perform certain Amazon S3 actions on buckets or objects with SageMaker, Sagemaker, sagemaker, or aws-glue in the name. To learn how to add an additional policy to an execution role to grant it access to other Amazon S3 buckets and objects, see Add Additional Amazon S3 Permissions to a SageMaker Execution Role.\n\nTo create a new role\n\nOpen the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.\n\nSelect Roles and then select Create role.\n\nSelect SageMaker.\n\nSelect Next: Permissions.\n\nThe IAM managed policy, AmazonSageMakerGeospatialFullAccess is automatically attached to this role. To see the permissions included in this policy, select the sideways arrow next to the policy name. Select Next: Tags.\n\n(Optional) Add tags and select Next: Review.\n\nGive the role a name in the text field under Role name and select Create role.\n\nIn the Roles section of the IAM console, select the role you just created. If needed, use the text box to search for the role using the role name you entered in step 7.\n\nOn the role summary page, make note of the ARN.\n\nPassing Roles\n\nActions like passing a role between services are a common function within SageMaker.
