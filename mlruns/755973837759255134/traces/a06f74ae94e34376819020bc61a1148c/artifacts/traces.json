You can manage your private repositories credentials using AWS Secrets Manager.\\n\\nSageMaker also offers SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes, which make it easier for developers and data scientists using Kubernetes to train, tune, and deploy ML models in SageMaker. These operators can be installed on a Kubernetes cluster in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) to create SageMaker jobs natively using the Kubernetes API and command-line tools such as kubectl.\\n\\nOverall, SageMaker provides a complete end-to-end ML development platform that is fully managed and scalable, allowing you to focus on building and training ML models without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.\"}"}
