You can install these SageMaker Operators on your Kubernetes cluster in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) to create SageMaker jobs natively using the Kubernetes API and command-line Kubernetes tools such as kubectl. This guide shows how to set up and use the operators to run model training, hyperparameter tuning, or inference (real-time and batch) on SageMaker from a Kubernetes cluster. The procedures and guidelines in this chapter assume that you are familiar with Kubernetes and its basic commands.\\n\\nImportant We are stopping the development and technical support of SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes in its original version. If you are currently using version v1.2.2 or below of the original version of SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes, we recommend migrating your resources to the latest SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes, the ACK service controller for Amazon SageMaker based on AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK). For information about the migration steps, see Migrate resources to the latest Operators. For answers to frequently asked questions regarding the end of support of the original version of SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes, see Announcing the End of Support of the Original Version of SageMaker Operator for Kubernetes\\n\\nBuy and Sell Amazon SageMaker Algorithms and Models in AWS Marketplace\\n\\nAmazon SageMaker integrates with AWS Marketplace, enabling developers to charge other SageMaker users for the use of their algorithms and model packages.
