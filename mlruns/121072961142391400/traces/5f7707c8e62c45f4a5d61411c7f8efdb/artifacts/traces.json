A user role is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the user can and can not do within AWS. An execution role is an IAM role that grants the service permission to access your AWS resources. An execution role consists of permissions and trust policy. The trust policy specifies which principals have the permission to assume the role.\n\nUse the following procedure to create an execution role with the IAM managed policy, AmazonSageMakerGeospatialFullAccess, attached. If your use case requires more granular permissions, use other sections of this guide to create an execution role that meets your business needs.\n\nEvery organization has its own set of standards and practices that provide security and governance for its AWS environment. SageMaker provides a set of first-party templates for organizations that want to quickly get started with ML workflows and CI/CD. The templates include projects that use AWS-native services for CI/CD, such as AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeCommit. The templates also offer the option to create projects that use third-party tools, such as Jenkins and GitHub.
